# PROJECT SOVEREIGN Tutorials

Learn PROJECT SOVEREIGN step by step with these hands-on tutorials.

## Getting Started

1. **[Installation](installation.md)** - Set up your development environment
2. **[First Program](first-program.md)** - Write and run your first program
3. **[Understanding Stacks](stacks.md)** - Master the stack-based execution model
4. **[Using the REPL](repl.md)** - Interactive development and debugging

## Core Concepts

5. **[Working with Memory](memory.md)** - Load, store, and manage data
6. **[Control Flow](control-flow.md)** - Jumps, conditions, and functions
7. **[Arithmetic Operations](arithmetic.md)** - Calculations and logic

## Advanced Topics

8. **[Writing Functions](functions.md)** - Modular programming patterns
9. **[Error Handling](error-handling.md)** - Robust error management
10. **[Self-Modifying Code](self-modifying.md)** - Homoiconic programming

## AI Integration

11. **[Using LLMGEN](llmgen.md)** - Generate code with LLM
12. **[Evolution with EVOLVE](evolve.md)** - Self-improvement mechanisms
13. **[Building Agents](agents.md)** - Autonomous program development

## Practical Examples

14. **[Data Structures](data-structures.md)** - Implementing stacks, queues, lists
15. **[Algorithms](algorithms.md)** - Sorting, searching, and more
16. **[System Programming](system.md)** - File I/O and system interaction

## Tutorial Format

Each tutorial includes:
- **Objectives**: What you'll learn
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge
- **Concepts**: Theory and background
- **Examples**: Working code samples
- **Exercises**: Practice problems
- **Solutions**: Detailed answers

## Learning Path

### Beginner Path
1. Installation → First Program → Understanding Stacks → Using the REPL

### Intermediate Path
2. Working with Memory → Control Flow → Arithmetic Operations → Writing Functions

### Advanced Path
3. Self-Modifying Code → Using LLMGEN → Evolution with EVOLVE → Building Agents

## Code Conventions

Throughout these tutorials, we use consistent conventions:

```assembly
; Comments explain the why
main:                  ; Labels use snake_case
    PUSH #42          ; Instructions indented 4 spaces
    CALL process      ; Meaningful names
    HALT             ; Clean exit

process:
    ; Function documentation
    ; Input: Value on stack
    ; Output: Processed value on stack
    DUP
    MUL              ; Square the value
    RET
```
