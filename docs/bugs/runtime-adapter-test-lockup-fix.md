# Runtime Adapter Test Lockup Issue - RESOLVED

**Status**: RESOLVED ✅  
**Affected Test**: `tests/unit/test_llm_integration.py::TestRuntimeAdapter::test_initialize`  
**Issue Date**: 2025-06-20  
**Resolution Date**: 2025-06-20  

## Problem Description

The test `TestRuntimeAdapter::test_initialize` was causing infinite lockups during test execution. The test would hang indefinitely, requiring manual termination.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `LLMRuntimeAdapter.initialize()` method in `src/project_sovereign/agents/runtime_adapter.py`:

```python
# Original problematic code (lines 50-51)
while self._loop is None or not self._loop.is_running():
    pass  # Infinite busy-wait loop!
```

### Why This Caused Lockups

1. **Busy-wait loop**: The code used a busy-wait loop without any sleep, consuming 100% CPU
2. **Test mocking issue**: The test mocked `threading.Thread.start()` but didn't properly mock the event loop state
3. **No timeout**: The loop had no timeout mechanism, so if the condition never became true, it would run forever
4. **In tests**: Since the thread start was mocked, the event loop never actually started, making the condition permanently false

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed the Runtime Adapter Code

**File**: `src/project_sovereign/agents/runtime_adapter.py`

```python
# Fixed code with timeout and sleep
timeout = 5.0  # 5 second timeout
start_time = time.time()
while (self._loop is None or not self._loop.is_running()) and (time.time() - start_time) < timeout:
    time.sleep(0.01)  # Small sleep to avoid busy-waiting

if self._loop is None or not self._loop.is_running():
    raise RuntimeError("Failed to start event loop within timeout")
```

**Changes made**:
- Added `import time` 
- Added 5-second timeout mechanism
- Added `time.sleep(0.01)` to prevent busy-waiting
- Added proper error handling if timeout is reached

### 2. Fixed the Test Code

**File**: `tests/unit/test_llm_integration.py`

```python
def test_initialize(self, adapter):
    """Test adapter initialization."""
    # Mock the event loop and thread
    mock_loop = MagicMock()
    mock_loop.is_running.return_value = True
    
    # Mock future for async_initialize
    mock_future = MagicMock()
    mock_future.result.return_value = None
    
    # Mock the async initialization to prevent coroutine warning
    async def mock_async_init():
        return None
    
    with (
        patch("threading.Thread.start"),
        patch("asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe", return_value=mock_future),
        patch.object(adapter, "_loop", mock_loop),
        patch.object(adapter, "_async_initialize", side_effect=mock_async_init)
    ):
        adapter.initialize()

        assert adapter._initialized is True
```

**Changes made**:
- Added proper mocking of the event loop with `is_running() = True`
- Added mocking of `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`
- Added mocking of the `_async_initialize` method to prevent coroutine warnings
- Used proper patch context managers

## Verification

- ✅ Test `TestRuntimeAdapter::test_initialize` now passes quickly
- ✅ All other `TestRuntimeAdapter` tests continue to pass
- ✅ No more infinite lockups during test execution
- ✅ Core functionality remains intact

## Prevention Measures

1. **Always add timeouts** to wait loops in production code
2. **Use sleep statements** in wait loops to prevent busy-waiting  
3. **Proper test mocking** of async components and event loops
4. **Test isolation** - ensure mocked components behave consistently
